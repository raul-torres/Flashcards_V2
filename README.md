## Description


Flashcard application where you can create, and quiz yourself with different cards. You can also interact with other user created cards and quiz yourself with them. This full-stack application uses one-to-many schema relationship, login/registration with validations, BCrypt password hashing, and session to keep you logged in. 

**WORKING PROGRESS. The application itself works correctly and you can quiz yourself with the cards and decks that you/other users have created. CSS/Javascript still has a couple of bugs due to cross-platform issues.

**PROJETCT IN HAITUS. Eventually, I will come back to make sure the CSS works correctly for all devices. For now feel free to enjoy all the other projects I release!
